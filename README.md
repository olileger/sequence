Another low-code tool to point-to-click your automation

The goal of this project is to ease the exchange of messages between applications to make life easier.
Somewhere it's an IFTTT-like but since IFTTT isn't free anymore and 3rd party integration is quite obscure I decided to code my own tool.

## First Approach
Idealy it's a point to click tool who direct-map actions and connectors to code.
This code is then run on local computer or in the cloud - I may provide this runtime "as a Service" with related licensing but the runtime itself is targeted to be open source and free for all.
It's also intented to provide a connectors store to allow build complex scenarios between applications. Supported protocol will be HTTPS of type application/json.

I want it to be as fast as possible then I'll try to avoid uneeded compilation, packing, containerizing and all that stuff. That's why a direct mapping action-to-code will help.
